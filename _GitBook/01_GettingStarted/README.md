# Getting Started

[Rock RMS](https://www.rockrms.com/) has been developed by [Spark Development Network](https://sparkdevnetwork.com/), and it serves many functions. Among other things, Rock can serve as a:

1. Church Management System (Database)
2. Communication Tool
3. Digital Publishing Platform (CMS)

At its most basic, Rock wants to empower all churches to have a robust system even if said church doesn't have a Systems Developer on staff. But because of its open-source nature, churches that do have a developer on staff get to customize their instance of Rock as deeply as they have the knowledge/capacity to customize it.

All that being said, there are some vocabulary words that will be helpful to you as you dive deeper into administering Rock as a system:
